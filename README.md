# Gist List
Create and organize code snippets, gists, and markdown files.

This is a small Rails app for storing and organizing snippets of code using groups and tags. Supports multiple users with secure Log-in. Very basic indentation for code is implemented color-coded syntax highlighting coming soon. Other features to be added later: search by tag/keyword/language, sorting by name/date/snippet-size, CSS styling and UX improvements, deploy to Heroku.
